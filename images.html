Gautama Buddha was the 140th King of the Suryavamsa. At the age of 29, Gautama Buddha left his palace to meet his subjects. Touched by the human conditions that he saw, he started a deep spiritual quest. At 35, while seated under a Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India, he attained enlightenment. He travelled far and wide and taught the Science of Realising The Truth through three teachings: The Three Universal Truths, The Four Noble Truths, and The Noble Eightfold Path. He left the body at 80. His teachings were absorbed into what is today called Buddhism.
